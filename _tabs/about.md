Students â€“ will have a student friendly interface with transparent rental process with timely approvals and notifications.

>Unique value proposition

>Using Azure AD authentication will provide secure login and easy access to the system without the need to remember additional credentials.
Using a MySQL database with Azure SQL is the best choice for cost and scalability, being highly adaptable to a huge number of frameworks and programs.  From this choice of database an application can be built to provide an easily accessible up to date digital resource.
Using ReactJS as the front-end will ensure that users will have a highly reactive UI where users can easily rent and manage equipment.
