3. ### Real-Time Inventory Tracking:

   The inventory management system will provide real-time updates on equipment availability. This feature will prevent double-bookings, conflicts, and disappointments arising from unawareness of equipment unavailability.

4. ### Rental History Recording and Insights:

   The software will maintain a comprehensive student rental database, recording rental history, past requests, and equipment return conditions. This database will offer valuable insights into student rental patterns, equipment popularity, and return conditions.

5. ### Secure and Convenient Authentication:

   The system will integrate Azure AD authentication, enhancing security and ensuring a seamless login experience for users.

6. ### Flexible Loan Periods:

   The solution allows staff to set default loan periods for various items. Additionally, staff can modify timelines as needed, tailoring loan periods to accommodate specific situations and student needs.

7. ### Centralized Online Inventory Database:

   The project includes the creation of a centralized online inventory database. This database will store detailed information about each piece of equipment available for rent, making equipment management more efficient and organized.

8. ### Data-Driven Decision-Making:

   The integrated inventory and rental databases will provide valuable data analytics insights. This data-driven approach will empower the department to make informed decisions, optimize resource allocation, and improve overall efficiency.
